# gliderfs - the glider file server

Specific documentation for our group file server is kept here. 

We use this server for moving files around, automated data pipelies, and some minimal data processing.

How was it created? We asked Thomas Olson to spin us up an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS VM with 4 CPUs, 8 GB RAM and 256 GB of memory (all expandable in the future).

## Initial setup
